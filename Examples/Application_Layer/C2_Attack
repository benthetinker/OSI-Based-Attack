💻 Layer 7 (Application Layer) – Command and Control via HTTP (Beaconing)

🎯 Goal: Detect if HTTP traffic is being used to maintain an external connection (C2)

🔎 Wireshark Steps:
Filter: http.request or dns.qry.name
Look for:
  -Periodic connections to same external domain (**can use statistic conversation or IO graph to spot the suspicious outbound traffic**)
  -URIs with suspicious strings (e.g., encoded payloads, random characters)
  -HTTP POSTs with unknown content-type or base64 blobs
  -Suspicious URI/Domain (**VirusTotal website to confirm**)
  -Suspicious user agent (**User Parse a user agent website to confirm**)

Malware authors often:
✅ Use weird, fake, or outdated User-Agents
✅ Use hardcoded User-Agents (same across victims)
✅ Try to imitate browsers poorly
🔍 Suspicious examples:
  -Microsoft WebDAV 1.0
  -python-requests/2.27.1
  -botnet-client
  -curl/7.35.0 (used in basic scripts)
  -Missing or empty User-Agent

🧠 Analyst Mindset:
-"Is this normal browser behavior or malware beaconing?"
-"Does this host communicate regularly to a low-reputation domain?"

📷 Tip: Extract the full TCP stream and analyze for payloads or encoded indicators


**🛠️ Corrective / Preventive Actions:**

| Type              | Action                                                         |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Short-term Fix    | Block domain/IP at DNS or proxy level                          |
| Monitoring        | Use behavioral analytic (e.g. SIEM alerts for beacon timing)   |
| Policy & Training | Educate users on phising vectors that enable initial infection |
| Long-term         | Implement EDR and sandbox inspection for outbound behavior     |
