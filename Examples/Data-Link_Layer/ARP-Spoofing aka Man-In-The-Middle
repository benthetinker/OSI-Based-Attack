# 💻 Layer 2 (Data Link Layer) – ARP Spoofing aka Man In The Middle (MITM) Attack

**🎯 Goal:** Detect if an attacker is conducting an ARP spoofing MITM attack

**🔎 Wireshark Steps:**
- Filter: `arp`
- Look for:
  - Many unsolicited ARP replies (e.g., "Who has"/"is-at")
  - One MAC address claiming multiple IPs
- Follow TCP stream between attacker and victim to inspect MITM traffic

**🧠 Analyst Mindset:**
- “Who is claiming ownership of IPs they shouldn’t?”
- “Is there an ARP reply storm without matching ARP requests?”
- "2 MAC addresses claimed the same IP address"
- "One MAC address crafted multiple ARP requests against a range of IP addresses."

**🛠️ Corrective / Preventive Actions:**

| Type              | Action                                                      |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Short-term Fix    | Flush ARP cache, isolate suspicious MAC, renew DHCP leases  |
| Monitoring        | Enable Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on switches             |
| Policy & Training | Enforce static IP-MAC bindings in critical segments         |
| Long-term         | Deploy IDS/IPS like Snort/Suricata for Layer 2 anomalies    |
