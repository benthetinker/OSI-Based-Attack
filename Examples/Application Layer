💻 Layer 7 (Application Layer) – Command and Control via HTTP (Beaconing)

🎯 Goal: Detect if HTTP traffic is being used to maintain an external connection (C2)

🔎 Wireshark Steps:
Filter: http.request or dns.qry.name
Look for:
  -Periodic connections to same external domain
  -URIs with suspicious strings (e.g., encoded payloads, random characters)
  -HTTP POSTs with unknown content-type or base64 blobs

🧠 Analyst Mindset:
-"Is this normal browser behavior or malware beaconing?"
-"Does this host communicate regularly to a low-reputation domain?"

📷 Tip: Extract the full TCP stream and analyze for payloads or encoded indicators


**🛠️ Corrective / Preventive Actions:**

| Type              | Action                                                         |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Short-term Fix    | Block domain/IP at DNS or proxy level                          |
| Monitoring        | Use behavioral analytic (e.g. SIEM alerts for beacon timing)   |
| Policy & Training | Educate users on phising vectors that enable initial infection |
| Long-term         | Implement EDR and sandbox inspection for outbound behavior     |
